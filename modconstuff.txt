Major infractions - in-drivable-lane_median
This is the median of the time spent outside of the drivable zones. For example this penalizes driving in the wrong lane.

Lateral deviation - deviation-center-line_median
This is the median lateral deviation from the center line.

Traveled distance - driven_lanedir_consec_median
This is the median distance traveled, along a lane. (That is, going in circles will not make this metric increase.)

This is discretized to tiles.

Survival time - survival_time_median
This is the median survival time. The simulation is terminated when the car goes outside of the road or it crashes with an obstacle or pedestrian.
